##Multi-Kinect Depth Capture

This is a tuning for the original Kinect Demo DepthBasic-D2D.

It utilizes UDP socket to sync two Kinect v2 cams within the same LAN. As the current SDK limits the use of multiple Kinect cams on a single PC. This code can be run on multiple PCs to start capturing depth information from multiple PCs.
